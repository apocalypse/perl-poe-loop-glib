# Create the user interface when the session starts.  This assumes
# some familiarity with Gtk.  ui_start() illustrates four important
# points.
#
# 1. Gtk events do not require require a main window.  It is therefore
# the responsibility of the programmer to create a main window (or
# not) herself.  POE::Kernel's signal_ui_destroy() method attaches a
# UIDESTROY signal to the destruction of a window.  In this case,
# closing the main window signals the program to shut down.
#
# 2. Widgets we need to work with later, such as the counter display,
# must be stored somewhere.  The heap is a convenient place for them.
#
# 3. Gtk widgets expect callbacks in the form of coderefs.  The
# session's postback() method provides coderefs that post events when
# called.  The Button created in ui_start() fires an "ev_clear" event
# when it is pressed.
#
# 4. POE::Kernel methods such as yield(), post(), delay(), signal(),
# and select() (among others) work the same as they would without Gtk.
# This feature makes it possible to write back end sessions that
# support multiple GUIs with a single code base.
